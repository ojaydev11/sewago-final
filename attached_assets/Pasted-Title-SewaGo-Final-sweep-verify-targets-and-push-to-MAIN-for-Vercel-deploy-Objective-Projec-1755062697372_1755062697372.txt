Title: SewaGo – Final sweep, verify targets, and push to MAIN for Vercel deploy

Objective
Project is tuned to Lighthouse targets. Do a last error sweep, verify metrics & core flows, ensure flags/env are correct (COD-only), and PUSH to GitHub MAIN so Vercel deploys. No code in chat; analyze and edit the repo directly.

Guardrails
- Keep ONLY the modern Next.js App Router app; one global stylesheet; no legacy CSS/“blue blobs”.
- Payments: COD is the ONLY live method. eSewa/Khalti remain integrated but DISABLED via flags.
- Preserve PWA installability and the achieved Lighthouse scores.

Tasks (in order)

0) Sanity & flags
- Confirm we’re operating in the Next app folder.
- Verify env/flags for production build:
  ESEWA_ENABLED=false
  KHALTI_ENABLED=false
  EMAILS_ENABLED=true
  WALLET_ENABLED=true
  PROMOS_ENABLED=true
  SURGE_ENABLED=false
  DISPUTES_ENABLED=true
  CITIES_TOOLKIT_ENABLED=true
  SUPPORT_CENTER_ENABLED=true
  TRAINING_HUB_ENABLED=true
  PERSONALIZATION_ENABLED=true
  PARTNER_API_ENABLED=false
  WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=false
- Ensure there is only ONE <Navbar/> (in layout), and NO full-screen gradients/pseudo-elements.

1) Final checks – PWA / SEO / A11y / Perf
- Confirm manifest + icons, service worker registered, offline page works for pre-cached routes.
- Validate JSON-LD (Organization + Service + Breadcrumb on service/city pages).
- Ensure canonical URLs, robots.txt, sitemap.xml include /, /services, service slugs, and service×city pages.
- Re-run Lighthouse (mobile) on / and one /services/[slug]; record final scores.

2) Core smoke tests (fast)
- Home renders once; no duplicate nav; no oversize backgrounds.
- /services grid loads; cards link to /services/[slug].
- One /services/[slug]: features, FAQs, reviews/warranty, “Book Now” works.
- Contact form submits (server log/OK state).
- Booking flow (COD only) completes; confirmation shows “Pay cash after service.”
- Provider onboarding (lite) completes; admin approval toggles “Verified” badge.
- Dispute flow: open → status shown.
- PWA: “Install app” works; offline-lite shows cached pages.

3) Vercel deploy readiness
- Verify Vercel root directory is the Next app path; add DEPLOY_NOTES if anything changed.
- Clear any large unoptimized images >200KB above the fold.
- No console errors in production build.

4) Git push to MAIN
- Ensure git remote points to the correct GitHub repo.
- Conventional commit:
  chore(release): finalize PWA/SEO/a11y/perf, verify flows, push to main for Vercel
- Push directly to origin main. If main is protected, open a PR with same title and note it needs approval.

5) Post-deploy verification
- Paste the production Vercel URL.
- Paste final Lighthouse numbers (mobile) for / and one /services/[slug] and confirm PWA “Installable”.
- Confirm: COD-only live; eSewa/Khalti disabled; sitemap/robots present; JSON-LD valid; single navbar; all main buttons/flows work (contact, booking, provider approve, dispute).
