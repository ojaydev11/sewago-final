## 🔒 **CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES RESOLVED**

### ✅ **Payment Security (CRITICAL → RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: No webhook signature verification, vulnerable to payment fraud  
**Solution**: Implemented HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, idempotency protection, replay attack prevention  
**Evidence**: `backend/src/middleware/payment-security.ts`

### ✅ **Content Security Policy (HIGH → RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: Dangerous `unsafe-eval` allowing code injection  
**Solution**: Strict CSP with whitelisted domains only  
**Evidence**: `backend/src/middleware/enhanced-security.ts`

### ✅ **Authentication Vulnerabilities (HIGH → RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: JWT tokens vulnerable to attacks, no CSRF protection  
**Solution**: Token rotation, secure storage, CSRF middleware  
**Evidence**: Enhanced authentication middleware

### ✅ **Input Validation (HIGH → RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: NoSQL injection vulnerabilities  
**Solution**: Comprehensive Zod validation + input sanitization  
**Evidence**: Request sanitization middleware

---

## 🛠️ **SECURITY CONTROLS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced Security Middleware Suite**
```typescript
✅ Strict Content Security Policy with payment gateway whitelist
✅ HSTS with preload for transport security
✅ Rate limiting per endpoint type (auth: 5/15min, payment: 10/1min)
✅ Request ID tracking and security audit logging
✅ Input sanitization for NoSQL injection prevention
✅ CSRF protection for state-changing operations
```

### **2. Payment Security Framework**
```typescript
✅ HMAC signature verification for eSewa/Khalti webhooks
✅ Idempotency protection against duplicate transactions
✅ Replay attack prevention (5-minute timestamp window)
✅ Payment amount validation and fraud detection rules  
✅ Transaction audit logging with severity classification
✅ Timing attack protection for signature verification
```

### **3. Authentication & Authorization Hardening**
```typescript
✅ JWT token rotation with secure refresh mechanism
✅ Strong password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
✅ Audience and issuer validation for JWT tokens
✅ Role-based access control with server-side validation
✅ Session timeout and secure cookie configuration
✅ Brute force protection with progressive delays
```

### **4. File Upload Security**
```typescript  
✅ Magic byte validation for file type verification
✅ Secure filename generation with UUIDs
✅ File size and extension restrictions
✅ MIME type validation and content scanning
✅ Secure storage with presigned URLs
✅ Antivirus scanning hooks (placeholder for production)
```
