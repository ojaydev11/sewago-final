## 📋 Dependency Security Analysis

### Backend Dependencies ✅
```json
{
  "vulnerabilities": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "moderate": 0,
    "low": 0,
    "total": 0
  },
  "status": "CLEAN"
}
```

### Frontend Dependencies ⚠️
```json
{
  "vulnerabilities": {
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "moderate": 0,
    "low": 3,
    "total": 3
  },
  "issues": [
    "cookie package: out-of-bounds characters (CVE-2024-47764)",
    "@auth/core: cookie dependency vulnerability",
    "next-auth: dependency chain issue"
  ],
  "status": "LOW RISK - MONITORED"
}
```

**Resolution**: Low-severity cookie vulnerabilities in next-auth dependencies. Impact is minimal as the application doesn't rely on next-auth for authentication (uses custom JWT implementation).
